## Activity 4a. Think about three hobbies and activities that you like doing in your free time. Use the ideas below and/or your own ideas.

exercise

relaxation

housework

sports

shopping

time with other people


### Solution
Here are three hobbies and activities I enjoy in my free time:

Exercise – I love staying active by going to the gym or taking long walks outdoors. It keeps me energized and helps clear my mind.

Relaxation – Reading a good book or listening to music are my favorite ways to unwind. It’s the perfect escape and helps me recharge.

Spending Time with Others – Whether it’s a casual coffee with friends or a family gathering, spending quality time with others is something I look forward to.

## Activity 4b. Prepare a short talk on these activities. Explain why you love these activities and how often you do them. Also mention what you don’t like about some of them. Use the language for talking about likes and dislikes below.

Talking about likes and dislikes

I'm not keen on …                                             My favourite... is...

I really love…                                                    I'm really interested in...

I'm really into…                                                 I don't mind...

I prefer …                                                          I quite like ...

I can't stand …


We generally use a noun or a verb + -ing after the likes and dislikes phrases.

I like swimming in the sea.


My favourite exercise is running because it helps me stay fit and also because I really love taking part in marathons. I do marathons about three times a year. But I don’t really like running in the rain.

### Solution

Here’s my talk on the three activities I enjoy in my free time:

My favourite activity is exercise, especially going to the gym and taking long walks outside. I really love the way exercise keeps me fit and gives me a boost of energy. I try to go to the gym at least three times a week, and I don’t mind pushing myself with challenging workouts. However, I’m not keen on crowded gyms – it can get quite busy at peak times, which sometimes makes it hard to stay focused.

I’m also really into relaxation, and my favourite way to relax is by reading a good book or listening to music. I usually read a bit every evening before bed, as it’s the perfect way to unwind after a busy day. I quite like exploring different genres of books, but I can’t stand distractions when I’m reading – it makes it hard to enjoy the story fully.

Finally, I quite like spending time with others, whether it’s catching up with friends over coffee or having family dinners. I really enjoy these moments because they help me stay connected and build stronger relationships. I don’t do this every day, but I try to meet friends at least once a week. I prefer small gatherings over big parties, though, as I find it easier to have meaningful conversations in a more relaxed setting.

## Activity 4c. Make a dialogue with a partner.  Student A, tell about your favourite free-time activities.  Student B, listen to your partner and ask follow-up questions to find out more. Then swap roles. Assess each other using the rubric below. 

Student describes three favourite activities and the reasons why he/she likes them.

Student mentions what he/she doesn’t really like about at least one of the activities.

Student explains how often he/she does the activities.

Student uses the frequency expressions and language for likes and dislikes from the lesson correctly.

**Student A**sks follow-up questions when listening to the partner.

**Student A**: Hi! Do you want to hear about my favorite free-time activities?

**Student B**: Sure, I'd love to! What do you enjoy doing in your free time?

**Student A**: Well, I really like going to the swimming pool. I usually go to the pool twice a week.

**Student B**: Oh, that sounds fun! Why do you like swimming so much?

**Student A**: I enjoy swimming because it helps me relax and stay fit. The water is always soothing(успокаивает), and I feel refreshed after a good swim.

**Student B**: That's great! Do you go in the mornings or evenings?

**Student B**: I see. Is there anything you don't like about swimming?

**Student A**: Sometimes the pool is crowded, and I don't enjoy it when there are too many people.

**Student A**: Occasionally, but I mostly prefer single-player games for the story.

**Student B**: Is there anything you don't like about gaming?

**Student A**: Well, sometimes I get so absorbed that I lose track of time, which isn't always good for my schedule.

**Student B**: I can relate to that! What else do you enjoy in your free time?

**Student A**: I love imagining worlds. Usually, I create stories based on Slavic mythology.

**Student B**: That sounds fascinating! What do you do with these worlds you create?

**Student A**: I write stories and sometimes play dnd. I love creativity.

**Student B**: Do you ever share your work with others?

**Student A**: Hardly ever. I'm a bit shy about it, but I'm trying to share more.(Почти никогда. Я немного стесняюсь этого, но стараюсь рассказать больше.)

**Student B**: You should! It sounds like you have a talent. Have you considered publishing your stories?

**Student A**: I've thought about it, but I never seem to find the time to pursue it seriously.

**Student B**: Maybe you could start a blog or join a writers' group.

**Student A**: That's a good idea. I'll consider it.

**Student B**: Is there anything you don't like about writing?

**Student A**: Sometimes I get writer's block, and it can be frustrating when ideas don't flow.

**Student B**: I understand. Creativity can be unpredictable.

**Student A**: Exactly. So, what about you? What are your favorite free-time activities?

**Student B**: Well, I enjoy hiking. I often go hiking on weekends.

**Student A**: That’s great! Where do you usually hike?

**Student B**: There are some hills near my town. I usually hike there most days when the weather is good.

**Student A**: Why do you like hiking?

**Student B**: I love being in nature, and it keeps me active. Plus, the views are amazing.

**Student A**: Do you go alone or with friends?

**Student B**: Usually with friends, but occasionally I go alone to enjoy some solitude.

**Student A**: Do you ever camp overnight?

**Student B**: Hardly ever. I prefer day hikes, but I'm open to trying camping sometime.

**Student A**: Is there anything you don't like about hiking?

**Student B**: Sometimes the weather is unpredictable, and I don't like when it rains during a hike.

**Student A**: I see. Do you ever encounter wild animals?

**Student B**: Occasionally, but nothing dangerous. Mostly just squirrels and birds.

**Student A**: That's good to hear. What else do you enjoy?

**Student B**: I also like reading. I nearly always read before bed.

**Student A**: What kind of books do you read?

**Student B**: Mostly fantasy and science fiction. I love getting lost in other worlds.

**Student A**: Oh, maybe you'd like my stories!

**Student B**: Definitely! You should let me read them sometime.

**Student A**: I'll think about it. Do you have a favorite author?

**Student B**: Yes, I really enjoy books by Ursula K. Le Guin.

**Student A**: I've heard of her but haven't read her books. Any recommendations?

**Student B**: "The Earthsea Cycle" is amazing. You should check it out.

**Student A**: I will. Do you ever write yourself?

**Student B**: Occasionally, but nothing serious. Just jotting down ideas.

**Student A**: That's cool. Maybe we can collaborate—you with your ideas and me with my stories.

**Student B**: That sounds like a great idea!

**Student A**: Do you have any other hobbies?

**Student B**: Yes, I play the guitar. I practice almost every day.

**Student A**: That's impressive! How long have you been playing?

**Student B**: For about five years now.

**Student A**: Do you perform anywhere?

**Student B**: Hardly ever. I mostly play for myself, but sometimes at family gatherings.

**Student A**: Do you ever write your own songs?

**Student B**: Occasionally, but I mostly play covers. I'm not that confident in my songwriting skills.

**Student A**: I'd love to hear you play sometime.

**Student B**: Sure, maybe we can meet up, and I'll bring my guitar.

**Student A**: That would be great. Is there anything you don't like about playing guitar?

**Student B**: Sometimes I hit a plateau, and it feels like I'm not improving, which can be discouraging.

**Student A**: I can understand that. But you keep practicing, and that's what matters.

**Student B**: Exactly. Do you ever feel that way with your swimming or writing?

**Student A**: Yes, sometimes. Especially with writing when ideas don't come easily.

**Student B**: Maybe we can motivate each other.

**Student A**: I'd like that.

**Student B**: By the way, have you ever tried combining your love for swimming and storytelling?

**Student A**: Hmm, not really. How would I do that?

**Student B**: Maybe write a story set underwater or about aquatic creatures from Slavic mythology.

**Student A**: That's an interesting idea! I never thought of that.

**Student B**: It could be a unique angle.

**Student A**: I'll definitely consider it. Thanks for the suggestion!

**Student B**: You're welcome. So, do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Student A**: I usually go swimming on Saturdays, and I might play some PlayStation on Sunday.

**Student B**: Sounds good. I'm planning a hike if the weather stays nice.

**Student A**: Maybe I can join you sometime.

**Student B**: That would be fun! You're always welcome.

**Student A**: Thanks. Well, it was great chatting about our hobbies.
